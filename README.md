# Office UI Fabric and Office 365 Theme support for SharePoint Framework Projects

This NPM package allows you to use theme token from Office UI Frabric in SharPoint Framework Projects.

# Installation
Create a new SharePoint Framework Project and add this package to your project.

```bash
npm install --save-dev spfx-uifabric-themes 
```

After this installation this package should be listed as a dev dependency in your SPFX Project.

# Usage
Go to any of your `.module.scss` files in your project and include the following SASS @import statement 

```scss
// For all tools and utlities
@import './node_modules/spfx-uifabric-themes/office.theme';
```

If only the color variables are needed in the SPFX Project only the variables can be included too.

```scss
// For color variables only
@import './node_modules/spfx-uifabric-themes/office.theme.vars';
```

After that you can use theme slots like `$ms-themePrimary`.

```scss
@import './node_modules/spfx-uifabric-themes/office.theme';

.container {
  background-color: $ms-themePrimary;
}
// For Error Messages use you can pass: alert, error, info, servere, success
.custErrorMsg{
  padding: 0 1em;
  line-height: 2em;
  @include stateStyle('error');
}

```

This will automatically add the theme slot for the background color.

```css

.container_742604fa {
  background-color: "[theme:themePrimary, default:#0078d7]"
}

.custErrorMsg_742604fa {
  padding: 0 1em;
  line-height: 2em;
  background-color: "[theme:errorBackground, default: #fde7e9]";
  color: "[theme:errorText, default: #333333]"
}
```

# Use TypeDefinitions for `window.__themeState__` object

In your web part code add the following line to your webpart or extension project.

```typescript
import {Theme} from 'spfx-uifabric-themes';
```

After that you should see the following extensions on the window object.
